As a gamer who plays CS:GO / CS2 (Counter Strike: Global Offensive / 2), I also enjoy following matches of professional players/teams. I especially watch [Eternal Fire](https://eternalfire.gg/), the biggest team in Turkey. As someone interested in statistics, it would be inevitable for me not to be interested in data about CS players and teams. Therefore, I decided to create datasets containing statistics of the team and players I follow. Thus, a large dataset folder has been prepared for those interested in analyzing both EF and CS data.

This dataset consists of statistics provided by [hltv.org](https://www.hltv.org/).
